I realized my current job has no future. There's pretty much no way to get a promotion, or achive something more.
While I was thinking what else I could do, my friend suggested me to read about programming. I've decided to give it a shot.
At the beggining I only wanted to try if it was even for me, but with each passing day it was turning from simply learing, to actually
having fun while doing it. After some thought I've decided to try my best at changing my career, and that's what brought me here.
